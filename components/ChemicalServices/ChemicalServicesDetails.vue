              Running an AC unit that's operating at less than peak efficiency can cost
              you money. Keeping it in good working order is vital if you want to keep
              your home comfortable without paying sky-high electricity bills. This is why
              it's always a good idea to address any performance issues you notice sooner
              rather than later.

              How long does it take it to cool down a room when you switch it on? A clean,
              efficient air conditioning unit should be able to get the job done in ten
              minutes or less. If it has to work for longer than that, it's burning up
              excess power and costing you money. It may require a chemical wash.
              Replacement isn't the only answer when it isn't working the way it used to.
              A little bit of tender loving care is often sufficient to get it back to its
              peak performance.
